Don't mind the folders, they're just source folders. Just open "Home" to see the website. Please note that the results of the website varies per screen resolution. You might need to zoom-in or -out to see the results at its best. I recommend using windows browsers such as Chrome, Edge etc. as I haven't tested this in macbooks/apple/safari. After viewing the entire website you may read "for miwa". Thanks!
